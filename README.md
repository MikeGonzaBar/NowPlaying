## Recent Updates & Fixes

### Xbox Achievement Tracking Fix (Latest)

- **Issue**: Xbox games were not appearing in the "Most Achieved üèÜ" section despite having high achievement percentages

  - Updated `calculateAchievementPercentage()` function to handle all game types (Steam, PSN, Xbox, RetroAchievements)
  - Fixed import conflicts between `utils.ts` and `typeGuards.ts`
